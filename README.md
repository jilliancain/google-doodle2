December 4th 

*National Cookie Day is a minor holiday, celebrating cookies in all their sugary glory. It occurs on December 4th of every year, but is not widely observed.

*Cookie Monster proclaimed his own National Cookie Day in the 1980 book The Sesame Street Dictionary.

*Did you know that the English word "cookie" is derived from the Dutch word "koekje," which means little cake? Dutch bakers used to test oven temperatures on small amounts of batter so that they would not waste the entire cake mix if the temperature wasn't right. It was not long before they discovered that these tiny pieces of cooked batter were actually quite tasty!

Cookies come in all different flavors, shapes, and sizes. To celebrate National Cookie Day, bake a few batches of your favorite variety and invite your friends over for a cookie swap with a festive digital invitation! When you use digital invitations instead of paper, you help the Earth by cutting back on excess paper waste.
